The day I felt the need to log things in written formula has come. As a fresh C++ developer in a huge corporation I have a chance to learn things and <i>make the world a better place</i>. This means, my home page will be mostly about how I solved some problems in a complicated world of C++. I am not (yet) en experienced developer, so do not threat my solutions like design patterns - these will be just some of my ideas, that came to my mind, when I feel there's something wrong in the code I wrote or have to refactor. You, my dear reders, are here to review the ideas, discuss them, and when they are good enough, take and use in your own projects.

But this blog won't be only about programming - I will share lots of other things that are connected to my personal non-geeky interests here. Well... at least not as geeky as programming :)

That's all for today.
